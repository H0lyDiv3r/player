# Welcome!
this is a local Music Player that runs on the Browser! i created it when i couldn't find a good music player for linux.

# to start
go into the root folder and run the start bash file. that will take care of everything. 


# alternatively

you need to install the dependencies of both the front end and backend
build the front end with npm run build
move the dist folder from the front end to backend
and then run backend with npm run start

## Usage
when open your player in a browser of your choice at localhost:6173
you should get a page that looks like this

the first thing you need to do is scan your directory where you store you music. so on the sidebar go to the home tab and click on "Add Directory". you should get a dir navigator like this

once you get the navigator simply navigate to your music directory and select it by "CLICKING ON IT ONCE, (if you go inside the directory it will not be scanned)" and click on the scan button.

refresh the page or switch tabs and go back to the home tab and you will see a map of your music directory. if a directory doesnt have music on it it will not show up ont he map
